# Copy the clang resource files (include, lib, share). The clang cross
# build installs the main headers, but since we didn't build the runtimes
# (compiler-rt), we're lacking the files that are installed by them. The
# compiler-rt build primarily installs some libs, but also a few files under
# share, and headers for some of the runtime libraries.
#
# Instead of trying to merge these files on top of the headers installed
# by the clang cross build, just wipe the existing files and copy the whole
# resource directory from the complete toolchain. As long as it's a matching
# version of clang, the headers that were installed by it should be identical.
#
# Alternatively, we could copy the lib and share subdirectories, and
# copy the individual include subdirectories that are missing.
